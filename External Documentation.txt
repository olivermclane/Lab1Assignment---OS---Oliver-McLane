In Lab 1, I’ve created a program that has 4 threads for each worker and confirmed I have a main thread. 
In the Plant.java we implement Runnable and have 4 threads that take each operation one at 
a time (per thread) to run a process on an orange untill the State of 
the Orange changes to the next State, once the final state is reach the orange is discards as at 
the point it’s just scraps. After the time has run out for working on the 
oranges, the program will print out a summary of the oranges processed, 
the oranges wasted, oranges bottled, and the provided oranges. In my 
implementation, I’ve decided to have two threads do two of the process 
and two of the threads do the other two, which allowed me to reach the requirements. I experience a lot of challenges with syncing my 
threads to split and do task parallelization. I also struggled with the assignment to just understand the complex logic and 
complexity of the multithreaded program.
